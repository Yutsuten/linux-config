# linux-config

Configure my linux environment.
This configures some tools like Git, Zellij, Helix and Fish.

It uses [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) as Window Manager.

## Usage

Apply the configuration:

```shell
make
sudo make system
```

This only places the configuration files.
The installation of the applications should be done separately.
